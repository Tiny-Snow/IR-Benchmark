# Item Recommendation Benckmark

## :memo: Introduction

This repository collects the open source **Item Recommendation benchmark datasets and SOTA models**, in order to facilitate the research of item recommendation. 

In this repository, we provide the unified interface for data processing, model selection, training and evaluation. We hope that this repository can help researchers to quickly reproduce the SOTA models and fairly compare the preformance of different models.

Our aim is to build a up-to-date benchmark for Item Recommendation. We will be very grateful if you want to contribute new datasets or models to this repository.
